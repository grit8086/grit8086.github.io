# Arcana – Curated List of Useful Offensive Tradecraft Resources

## Low-Level Languages

- [C](https://www.learn-c.org/)

## Low-Level Concepts

Build core knowledge around system internals, cryptography, and debugging.

- Obfuscation, encryption, decryption, and common algorithms
- Learn to use debuggers (e.g., x64dbg)

### Windows Internals

- [Introduction to Malware Development](https://anteiku.fun/papers/an-introduction-to-modern-malware-development-for-red-teams/02_portable_executables/)
- [cr0w – Processes, Threads & Handles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNEqC-U5tHM&t=527s)
- Download [**Windows Internals, Part 1**](https://empyreal96.github.io/nt-info-depot/Windows-Internals-PDFs/Windows%20System%20Internals%207e%20Part%201.pdf) and use it as a reference whenever you want to dive deeper into a topic you're currently learning.

### Project Ideas

Try to replicate a malware behavior and ask:

- What is being performed?
- How is it being performed?
- Are there alternative techniques?
- Can we replicate the API usage?

### Practical EDR Evasion

Deploy the client's EDR in a lab and test your payload against it. When something gets detected, identify the behavior or artifact that triggered the alert, research the detection mechanism, then modify your tradecraft to address it.

The workflow is essentially:

> **Deploy EDR → Run payload → Observe detection → Identify the cause → Research → Address the detection surface → Retest**

Don't blindly apply evasion techniques. Understand what is being detected and why, then solve that specific detection problem. Keep useful telemetry such as Sysmon, ETW, Windows Event Logs, memory and call-stack visibility, and network telemetry available so you can correlate EDR alerts with what actually happened.

For example, if a loader is detected, determine whether the signal came from the executable itself, process behavior, memory characteristics, call stacks, or network activity. Address the relevant detection surface rather than changing unrelated parts of the payload.

The same principle applies to techniques such as Kerberoasting: understand the underlying telemetry and expected baseline first, then determine what behavior distinguishes your activity from normal operations.
